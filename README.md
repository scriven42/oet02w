# OpenEyeTap 02w

This is both an update to, and a new design for, the OpenEyeTap by Prof. Steve Mann.

## Background

I've personally been interested in computers since I was a child, and wearables for almost as
long. I came across the OpenEyeTap project and thought it was fantastic, but I have to wear glasses
and there wasn't an included "case" for that. It was also based on the Raspberry Pi Zero, which is fine
as a simple proof of concept, but it's quite underpowered. Since the OET project was paused, RPi has released
the Zero 2, which has the power of a standard RPi 3 but a formfactor almost exactly like the OG Zero. And
there has also been a major change in the Raspberry Pi OS as to how the cameras are handled in the background.

With this all in mind, I set out in the late 20-teens to take all my general "wearabe computer" notes and
see what I could do with them when basing everything on the OpenEyeTap concept.
